# Full-Stack Netflix clone

### Built from scratch with:
  - React.js
  - Redux as state manager
  - Sass (css pre-processor)
  - Firebase (used for Auth, membership management, saving user preferences)
  - Stripe API (user to manage payments world-wide and activate memberships)
 

### Takeaways

 - I made this project to expand my knowledge & abilities, I made it completly from scatch thinking in every small step how could I solve each problem. <br>
 - This project made me learn a lot more about Firebase and managing Authentification with Redux.<br>
 - Managing the payments with Stripe, giving membership and access after receiving the money, checking if the user has an active membership, was all a tough challenge at the moment that I built this project, but I learnead a ton doing it. I'm gratefull with myself for pushing me foward on this project. <br>
 - I tried to build the UI the most similar possible to the real product, and that sky-rocked my CSS abilities at that time. <br>
