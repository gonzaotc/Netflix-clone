# Full-Stack Netflix clone

### Built from scratch with:
  - React.js
  - Redux as state manager
  - Sass (css pre-processor)
  - Firebase (used for Auth, membership management, saving user preferences)
  - Stripe API (user to manage payments world-wide and activate memberships)
 

### Takeaways

 - I made this project to expand my knowledge and development abilities, i made it completly from scatch, thinking solutions for every single small step and how could I solve it by myself. <br>
 - This project made me learn a lot more about managing Authentification + users data/state with Redux and Firebase.<br>
 - Managing payments with Stripe, giving membership and access after receiving the payments, checking if the user has an active membership, was all a tough challenge at the moment i built this project, but I learnead a ton doing it. <br>
 - I tried to build the UI the most similar possible to the real product and that sky-rocked my CSS abilities at that time. <br>
